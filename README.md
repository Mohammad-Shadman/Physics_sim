# Physics_sim
a crude implementation of physics with collisions and uses HTML <canvas> to display. Far from finished and so WIP

-this is going to be a port of my c++ vector and newtonian physics engine with the use of JS and canvas for smoother visuals and faster responses instead of ncurses for display.
